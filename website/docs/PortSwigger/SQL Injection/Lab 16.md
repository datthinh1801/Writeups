# Lab: Blind SQL injection with out-of-band data exfiltration
## Task
This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The SQL query is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the `administrator` user.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.
