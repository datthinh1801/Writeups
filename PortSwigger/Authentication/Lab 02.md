# Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses
## Task
This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

[Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)  
[Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)  
To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

## Solution
